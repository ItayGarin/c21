21st Century C Header File
-----------------------------

Check out my blog post this - [21st Century C](http://www.garin.io/21st-c)

The `c21.h` header file contains useful modern definitions.

It was tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 machine with gcc 5.4 and clang 3.8.
By default, both of these compilers use the c11 standard.

Enjoy!
